## Neighborhood Map Project
Welcome to my Neighborhood Map project submission for Udacity's FEND program. This application will allow you to search for food in the Seattle, WA area (important when caught out in the rain). Simply browse the already full list of options for delectable delights in the emerald city to find your prefered eatery or use our handy dandy search box to find just what you're looking for (personal favorite: Skillet Food Truck).

Below you will find details on how to run the project and a bit about what was used to create it.

Happy hunting!

## Important Note!
I do not have a paid account for Google Maps, thus you will find that the map remains in a greyed out developer mode when run. 

## Program Details:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Location information/maps are pulled from the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) and the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/).
Location images are pulled from the [Google Street View API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro).

You will need to install Node and NPM to get going.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
